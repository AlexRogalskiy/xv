Setting up/updating a test framework can sometimes be complex and time consuming. I've created `xv` to be a test runner that is __low maintainance, easy to setup and use__. 

`xv` is great for __small and medium projects__.

## Features

- üê¶ __Lighweight__ - [`40 LOC`](https://github.com/typicode/xv/blob/main/src/bin.ts), with zero dependencies
- ‚ú® __Modern__ - native ESM support
- üî∞ __Simple & straightforward__ - no API to learn, zero-config
- ‚ö° __Super fast__ - with almost zero abstractions, `xv` is fast as Node

## Install

```sh
npm install xv --save-dev
yarn add xv --dev
```

## Usage

Create a test file `src/add.test.js` and use Node's built-in [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module:

```js
import { strict as assert } from 'assert' // Node <=16
// import assert from 'assert/strict'     // Node >=16

export function testAdd() {
  assert.equal(1 + 2, 3)
}
```

Edit `package.json`:

```js
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "xv src"
  }
}
```

Run your tests:

```sh
npm test               # run all test files in ./src
npx xv src/add.test.js # run a single test file
```

_`xv` is extremely simple, there's nothing else to learn._

## Convention

When provided a directory, `xv` will look for files named `*.test.js` (or `test.js`) and run exported functions sequentially.

## TypeScript

To use `xv` with TypeScript, compile your `.ts` files and run `xv` directly on compiled `.js`. This has the benefit of testing code that is really published.

For example, assuming your compiled files are in `lib/` :

```js
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "./lib"
  }
}
```

Edit `package.json` to run `xv` after `tsc`:

```js
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "rm -rf lib && tsc",
    "test": "npm run build && xv lib" // run test files in lib/
  }
}
```

If you're publishing to npm, exclude test files:

```js
// package.json
{
  "files": [
    "lib",
    // exclude compiled test files
    "!lib/**/*.test.js",
    "!lib/**/test.js"
  ]
}
```

You can run `npm publish --dry` to check that it's working (nothing is going to be published with the `--dry` option).
