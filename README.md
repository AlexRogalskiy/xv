## Why

- __User-friendly__ - zero-config, no API to learn, simple convention, ESM support
- __Extremely lighweight__ - only [`40 lines of code`](https://github.com/typicode/xv/blob/main/src/bin.ts) and no dependencies
- __Blazingly fast__ - with almost zero abstractions, xv is as fast as Node
- __Stable__ - very low maintenance
- __Unix philosophyâ„¢__ - `do one thing well`, xv is _only_ a test runner

[lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) (local JSON database), [steno](https://github.com/typicode/steno) (fast file writer) and other [awesome projects](https://github.com/typicode/xv/network/dependents) are using xv to run tests.

## Status

The project being very simple by design, there probably won't be frequent updates to the code (_which is a good thing for you, unless you like Dependabot alerts and updating devDependencies_). It will be updated to support latest Node releases and implement potential improvements. 

__tl;dr__ xv is maintained and used even though code updates may not be recent.

## Install

```sh
npm install xv --save-dev
```

## Usage

Create a test file and use Node's built-in [`assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) module:

```js
// src/add.test.js
import { strict as assert } from 'assert'

export function testAdd() {
  assert.equal(1 + 2, 3)
}
```

Edit `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "xv src"
  }
}
```

Run all test files:

```sh
npm test
```

Run a single test file:

```sh
npx xv src/add.test.js 
```

## Convention

When provided with a directory, xv will look for files named `*.test.js` or `test.js` and run exported functions sequentially.

## TypeScript

To test TypeScript code, compile your `.ts` files and run `xv` on compiled `.js` files. 

For example, assuming your compiled files are in `lib/`, edit `package.json` to run `xv` after `tsc`:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-   "test": "xv src"
+   "test": "tsc && xv lib"
  }
}
```

If you're publishing to npm, edit `package.json` to exclude compiled test files:

```diff
{
  "files": [
    "lib",
+   "!lib/**/*.test.js",
+   "!lib/**/test.js"
  ]
}
```

## Watch mode

xv doesn't integrate a watch mode. If the feature is needed, it's recommended to use tools like [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) or [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/chokidar-cli) to re-run xv when there are changes.
